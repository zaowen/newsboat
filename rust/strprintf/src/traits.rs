//! Traits required by `fmt!` macro.
//!
//! `fmt!` needs to convert values from Rust types like `u64` and `String` to C types like
//! `uint64_t` and `const char*`.
//!
//! For integer types, this happens automatically, e.g. `u64` can be passed directly into
//! `libc::snprintf`.
//!
//! Floating-point types are a bit more complicated: `f32` (C's `float`) has to be converted to
//! `f64` (C's `double`) because that's how variadic FFI works. `f64` can be passed over FFI
//! without any problems.
//!
//! Strings are the most complicated of all: Rust represents them as an array of bytes, whereas
//! C represents them as a chunk of memory terminated by a null byte. As a result, converting
//! a `String` into `const char*` requires an allocation to temporarily store a string in
//! a C-compatible fashion. `snprintf` doesn't understand Rust's borrowing, so we also need a Rust
//! object to hold that memory while `snprintf` works with a pointer to it.
//!
//! To support all of this, `fmt!` uses a two-stage process:
//! 1. convert a Rust type into an intermediate "holder" that owns a C-compatible representation of
//!    that value (`Printfable` trait);
//! 2. borrow the C-compatible representation of the value from the "holder" (`CReprHolder` trait).
//!
//! For example, a "holder" for a `String` is `std::ffi::CString`. It can be borrowed to call its
//! `to_ptr` method that returns `*const libc::c_char`.
//!
//! For numeric types, the holder is the same as the type itself, and the values are simply copied.
//! For example, `u64`'s "holder" is `u64`, which is then borrowed to get a `u64` again.
