Newsboat comes with the possibility to categorize or "tag", as we call it,
RSS feeds. Every RSS feed can be assigned 0 or more tags. Within Newsboat, you
can then select to only show RSS feeds that match a certain tag. That makes it
easy to categorize your feeds in a flexible and powerful way.

Usually, the _urls_ file contains one RSS feed URL per line. To assign a tag to
an RSS feed, simply attach it as a single word, separated by blanks such as
space or tab. If the tag needs to contain spaces, you must use quotes (`"`)
around the tag (see example below). An example _urls_ file may look like this:

	https://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html interesting conspiracy news "cool stuff"
	https://rss.orf.at/news.xml news orf
	https://www.heise.de/newsticker/heise.rdf news interesting

When you now start Newsboat with this configuration, you can press "t" to select
a tag. When you select the tag "news", you will see all three RSS feeds. Pressing
"t" again and e.g. selecting the "conspiracy" tag, you will only see the
https://blog.fefe.de/rss.xml?html RSS feed. Pressing "^T" clears the current tag,
and again shows all RSS feeds, regardless of their assigned tags.

A special type of tag are tags that start with the tilde character (`~`). When such
a tag is found, the feed title is set to the tag name (excluding the `~` character).
These type of tags are ignored when any kind of "first tag" property is used.
With this feature, you can give feeds any title you want in your feed list:

	https://rss.orf.at/news.xml "~ORF News"

Another special type of tag are tags that start with the exclamation mark (`!`). When
such a tag is found, the feed is hidden from the regular list of feeds and its 
content can only be found through a query feed.
