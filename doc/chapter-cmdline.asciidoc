Like other text-oriented software, Newsboat contains an internal commandline to
modify configuration variables ad hoc and to run own commands. It provides a flexible
access to the functionality of Newsboat which is especially useful for
advanced users.

To start the commandline, type ":". You will see a ":" prompt at the bottom of
the screen, similar to tools like vi(m) or mutt. You can now enter commands.
Pressing the "Enter" key executes the command (possibly giving feedback to the
user) and closes the commandline. You can cancel entering commands by pressing
the "Esc" key. The history of all the commands that you enter will be saved to
the _history.cmdline_ file, stored next to the _cache.db_ file. The backlog is
limited to 100 entries by default, but can be influenced by setting the
<<history-limit,`history-limit`>> configuration variable. To disable history
saving, set the `history-limit` to `0`.

The commandline provides you with some help if you can't remember the full
names of commandline commands. By pressing the "Tab" key, Newsboat will try to
automatically complete your command. If there is more than one possible
completion, you can subsequently press the "Tab" key to cycle through all
results. If no match is found, no suggestion will be inserted into the
commandline. For the <<cmd-set,`set`>> command, the completion also works for configuration
variable names.

In addition, some common key combination such as "Ctrl-G" (to cancel input),
"Ctrl-K" (to delete text from the cursor position to the end of line), "Ctrl-U" (to
clear the whole line) and "Ctrl-W" (to delete the word before the current cursor
position) were added.

Please be aware that the input history of both the command line and the search
functions are saved to the filesystems, to the files _history.cmdline_ resp.
_history.search_ (stored next to the _cache.db_ file). By default, the last 100
entries are saved, but this can be configured (configuration variable
<<history-limit,`history-limit`>>) and also totally disabled (by setting said
variable to `0`).

Currently, the following command line commands are available:
